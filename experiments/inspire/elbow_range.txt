Elbow

Two actuator. One speed control with 100 step/s. another constant force with 10N

Record two actuators position and force reading. But not at the same time, so need to repeat the same process for two times and record each actuator once at a time.

Position to engage wire     1500
Position to pre-tension     1200

actuator 1: constant force -10N
actuator 2: speed 100 step/s
